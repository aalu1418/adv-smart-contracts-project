## String Operations
Using assembly to implement various string operations that are not possible in normal solidity.

Four functions: ([discussed here](https://hackernoon.com/working-with-strings-in-solidity-c4ff6d5f8008))
- determining the stringâ€™s length
- reading the character at a given location in the string
- changing the character at a given location in the string
- joining two strings
- extracting part of a string
<!-- - Other functions (if time permitting - [JS string documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)):
  - toLowercase
  - toUppercase
  - includes -->
